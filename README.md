### 🔭 I'm currently working on...
Multi-agent orchestration platforms and AI-first development workflows. Consolidating 80+ experiments into production-grade tools that push the boundaries of what's possible with AI-assisted development.

### 🌱 I'm currently learning...
Reinforcement learning patterns for development tools, streaming architectures for large-scale data processing, and AI prompt engineering through systematic experimentation.

### 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on...
Practical AI tooling projects, multi-agent system design, and developer workflow optimization. Especially interested in projects that bridge the gap between AI capabilities and real-world productivity.

### 🤔 I'm looking for help with...
Scaling multi-agent systems, optimizing RAG performance for large codebases, and building intuitive interfaces for complex AI workflows.

### 💬 Ask me about...
- Multi-agent orchestration and AI development platforms
- Building production-ready AI tools from scratch
- The intersection of computer engineering and AI experimentation
- How to approach AI as an art form rather than just a tool

### 📫 How to reach me:
- GitHub: [@pagaldilz](https://github.com/pagaldilz)
- Open to collaboration on practical AI tooling and developer workflows

### ⚡ Fun fact:
I treat AI like a musical instrument—the more you practice, the better you get at coaxing out the right "notes" (responses). It's all about experimentation and close observation!

## Philosophy

*"AI is the new Google search—an art that needs to be perfected by experimentation and close observation."*

**Core Principles:**
- Learn by doing
- Push the limits of your learning  
- Reinvent yourself for the future
- Treat AI like an instrument—mastered by practice and attention

**What I Do:**
- Design and ship practical AI-first tools and workflows
- Explore multi-agent, RAG, and data-intensive patterns when they serve real outcomes
- Favor iterative delivery, measurement, and refinement over theory
